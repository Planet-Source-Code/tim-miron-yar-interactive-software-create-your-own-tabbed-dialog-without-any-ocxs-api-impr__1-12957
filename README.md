### Description

This is an IMPROVED version of my other "Create your own tabbed dialog" like the other this code lets you create a tabbed dialog (like the tabs used in property pages) without using any OCX/API!

In this version, I've gotten rid of that dotted focus box that used to appear on a tab when it was selected, and to make it look EVEN BETTER, as an option, the selected tabb will turn BOLD.

(SEE SCREEN SHOT) Please VOTE! Happy Programming! :)

Any comments would be appreciated! please vote.
